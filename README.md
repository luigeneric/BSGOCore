## Introduction
BSGOCore is an open-source game server emulator designed for hosting massively multiplayer online games (MMOPGs).
It is based on the discontinued game Battlestar Galactica Online (BSGO) and seeks to recreate the gameplay experience of the original game as well as provide additional features or change the existing behaviour.

---

The server is developed in Java (JDK 21) with Quarkus and built using Maven. SQLite is used as the default database, with schemas and migrations managed via Flyway.

This implementation is intentionally kept simple and pragmatic: it works and provides the needed functionality, but it is still in an early stage and not yet a polished solution. The database integration, for example, is rudimentary â€” data is buffered and written back periodically, resulting in behavior that is closer to eventual consistency rather than strict consistency. The current setup was designed to enable faster development and iteration rather than to represent a final or optimal architecture.

## Usage (WIP)
### Install prerequisites
- Game files are not provided, you have to own a copy yourself.
- Loginserver not provided (for testing not required)
- Chatserver not provided (for testing not required)
- Java (tested with JDK 21)
- Maven 3.9.9 or higher
### setup for test run
- copy contents ``.env.example`` to ``.env``
- edit .env, set
  - CLIENT_PATH
  - GAMESERVER_IGNORE_HASHES=true
- *The files are not yet provided* required: ServerConfigurationUtils folder (the server will search for template files and Cards (something like template files but in an ubiquitous language of the game)
  - AugmentTemplates
  - ColliderTemplates
  - JsonCards
  - LootTemplates
  - MissionTemplateConfiguration
  - SectorTemplates
  - ShipConfigTemplates
  - ZoneTemplates(empty, not implemented yet)
- start the server using the following command in the project root directory:
```
mvn clean quarkus:dev
// in another terminal (powershell)
// runclient will access the path to your client using .env file
.\runclient.bat 127.0.0.1 en
```
